**-March ~ December 2019**

The objective of this research is to build a mechatronic system to study proprioception in children. This system includes a mechanical design for the experiment setup, and a software system that acquires bio-data also delivers visual feedback. The aiming subject in this research is children between 3 to 6 years old. This system that provides visually attractive interfaces allows the participant to stay focus on the experimental tasks. The experiment contains a maximum torque test and perceptual testing tasks. This system carries on the experiment and records data for further research.

#### Motivation

Adults with stroke usually lose their ability to do sensorimotor tasks. Studies state that the brain of an adult has been developed well to achieve particular proficiency in limb movement patterns. Researches have shown that the human brain develops primary sensory and motor skills in one's early ages. In children, there is a higher chance that one can still perform functional sensorimotor tasks even with stroke. This project sets up an experiment to obtain data while children are performing sensorimotor tasks, ultimately, to understand the neuroplasticity of children with stroke.
